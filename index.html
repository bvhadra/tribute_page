   A musician, icon and innovator.... the one and only Mr David Bowie, who transcended music to another level.  From his breakthrough hit, 'Space Oddity', then into the 70s glam rock era, then the new wave 80s and beyond... Bowie was a pioneer and true legend of the music industry.  His influence has been infectious and he is the godfather to many great artists who took on his spirit and fashion. Here we pay tribute to one of our true legends of Great Britain!

        <h3 id="headline">Here are some milestones and key events of Bowie's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1947</strong> - Born in Brixton, London</li>
          <li><strong>1962</strong> - Bowie formed his first band, the Konrads, at the age of 15.</li>
          <li><strong>1969</strong> - "Space Oddity" was released five days ahead of the Apollo 11 launch, and reached the top five in the UK.  Bowie's first major single to break the top 5 UK charts!</li>
<li><strong>1970</strong> - Bowie's third album, The Man Who Sold the World, is released. It represents a departure from the acoustic guitar and folk-rock style established by Space Oddity, to a more hard rock sound.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1974</strong> - The album, 'Diamond Dogs', is released and reaches number one in the UK. Spawning the hits "Rebel Rebel" and "Diamond Dogs", it also reached number five in the US charts.  The album has flavours of soul and funk with two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1976</strong> - 'Station-to-Station' comes out... and it introduces a new persona... "The Thin White Duke".  The album develops his funk and soul, but now with more heavy use of synthesizers and synth-based arrangements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1980</strong> - 
It is now the 80s... and the new romantics are creeping in... with the growing use of synths.  Bowie realeases 'Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps).  It features the number-one hit "Ashes to Ashes".  It showcases the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from "Space Oddity". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1980</strong> - As Bowie was getting into his 80s pop, there was a new rising star called 'Gary Numan'.... and many believed that he was just another 'Bowie Clone'.  Gary Numan used a darker persona of Bowie, and he really exploited the synth technology.  Both artists were set to perform on the Kenny Everett Show at Christmas...  But, Bowie could not stand Numan being there... Bowie felt that Numan was copying his act. He demanded that Gary Numan should be taken off the show... and so Gary Numan had to leave! This demonstrated the power and influence that Bowie had...
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1983</strong> - Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with 'Let's Dance'. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1986</strong> - Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named "Absolute Beginners", rose to number two in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he worked with composer Trevor Jones and wrote five original songs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1989 - 1991: Tin Machine</strong> - Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1992–1998: Electronic Period</strong> - In 1993, Bowie released his first solo offering since his Tin Machine departure, the soul, jazz, and hip-hop influenced Black Tie White Noise. Making prominent use of electronic instruments, the album, which reunited Bowie with Let's Dance producer Nile Rodgers, confirmed Bowie's return to popularity, hitting the number-one spot on the UK charts and spawning three Top 40 hits, including the Top 10 single "Jump They Say".</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999–2012: Neoclassicist Era</strong> - In contrast to the experimental nature of Bowie's previus works, 'Hours' presents a pop rock and art pop style which is reminiscent of his 1970s work, further evoking styles and ideals previously explored on Bowie's past works.  Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2013–2016: Final Years</strong> - On 8 January 2013, his 66th birthday, his website announced a new album, to be titled 'The Next Day' and scheduled for release in March. It was Bowie's first studio album in a decade. The Next Day debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, was his first album to achieve that position since Black Tie White Noise (1993), and was the fastest-selling album of 2013 at the time.
          </li>       
          <li><strong>2016</strong> - David Bowie dies at the age of 69.</li>
